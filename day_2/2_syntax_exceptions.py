# In Python there are only two types of issues that will break your code
# --- stop your code from functioning or executing, and throw an error

# Syntax Errors : error in your coding grammar, a structural error
# --- misspelling
# --- indentation error
# --- code structure is missing something
# --- colons, indentations, parenthesis, " ", ' '

# Exceptions : arise when our code is structured correctly, but some operation doesn't execute for a variety of reasons

# --- ZeroDivisionError : occurs whe you try and divide by zero
# quotient = 10/0

# --- NameError : trying to call a variable or function before it's defined
# print(x)

# --- ValueError : trying to perform operations with invalid values

# str_num = 'nine'
# int_num = int(str_num) # trying to convert an invalid value

# --- TypeError : trying to perform operations on values of inappropriate types

# num = 5
# total_people = num + "people" # cannot concatenate a str and an int together

# --- AttributeError : trying to use methods on improper objects

# word = 'Hello'
# word.append("there")
